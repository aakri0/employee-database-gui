# Employee Database Application

This is a simple Employee Database application built using PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for Qt libraries. The application allows users to manage employee information, including adding new employees, searching for employees by ID, and displaying all employees in the database.

## Features

- **Add Employee**: Enter the name, department, and ID of an employee to add them to the database.

- **Search Employee**: Search for an employee by their ID and view their details if they exist in the database.

- **Display All Employees**: View a list of all employees currently in the database.
